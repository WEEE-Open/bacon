# Default Bacula Storage Daemon Configuration file

#  For Bacula release 9.4.2 (04 February 2019) -- ubuntu 20.04
#
# You may need to change the name of your tape drive
#   on the "Archive Device" directive in the Device
#   resource.  If you change the Name and/or the
#   "Media Type" in the Device resource, please ensure
#   that dird.conf has corresponding changes.

# Campa: are both of these following filechangers needed? they're not swappable floppys why

# Update: Reading on http://bacula.10910.n7.nabble.com/Virtual-autochanger-td84606.html it seems that 
# "Bacula's claim to support backup to disk is, let's say "optimistic", without vchanger"
